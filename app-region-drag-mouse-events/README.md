# OpenFin example: Draggable Elements & Mouse Events
The purpose of this demonstration is to show to create draggable areas by setting the CSS property of '-webkit-app-region: drag;'.

This is a vanilla JavaScript app free from frameworks and build systems, though you may add them as you see fit.

It has a simple Node/Express server for local development.

Clone the repo and run

```
$ npm install
```
NB: on a Mac you may need to type 'sudo npm install'

Navigate to the root folder where 'server.js' resides in your command line tool and run:

```
$ npm start
```

This should start a simple Node server at [http://localhost:9070](http://localhost:9070), then, launch the application via the node [OpenFin Launcher](https://npmjs.org/package/openfin-launcher);
