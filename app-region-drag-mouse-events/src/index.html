    <h1>Draggable Areas and Mouse Events</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this demonstration is to show how to create mouseover events and draggable areas on frameless windows by setting the CSS property of <pre>-webkit-app-region: drag;</pre>.</p>
    <p>We will set the app's draggable area on the DOM element with an id of 'toolbar'.</p>
    <p>The initial state of the DOM Elements with mouse listeners is orange and they have the CSS property '-webkit-app-region: no-drag;' to allow them to receive mouse Events, even when nested in a 'drag' region. When they receive a 'mouseover' they turn red and a 'mouseleave' turns them blue.</p>
