# OpenFin example: Snap and dock

This repo contains a modified version of the OpenFin snap and dock code [https://github.com/openfin/snap-and-dock](https://github.com/openfin/snap-and-dock).

It has a simple Node/Express server for local development.

Clone the repo and run

```
$ npm install
```
NB: on a Mac you may need to type 'sudo npm install'

Navigate to the root folder where 'server.js' resides with your command line tool and run:

```
$ npm start
```

This should start a simple Node server at [http://localhost:9070](http://localhost:9060), then, launch the app via the node [OpenFin Launcher](https://wwww.npmjs.org/package/openfin-launcher)
